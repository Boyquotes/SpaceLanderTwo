# SpaceLanderTwo

### (a working title)

The project is reborn.

##### 2 June 2023

* New movement system â€“ 'Asteroids'-style.
* Vastly simplified & more organised codebase to reduce the mounting complexity of both the original and the first Prototype effort(s) of this follow-up.
* The environments remain the sticking point.
  * Massive sprites?
  * Tilemaps?
  * Vector-style line drawings?
  * A mix of some or all of the above?

Roadmap:
    Decide on the environments and start designing gameplay.

For now this is a testing ground for systems only.
